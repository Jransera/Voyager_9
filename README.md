# Voyager_9:


Back in the 2018/2019 School year, I alongside a group of other college students created a text based adventure game named Control. We built it within Twine, as a final project for our Critical Video Game Studies class. In that game we wanted to focus on how colonialism, dehumanizes those being colonised, and the dark nature of traveling to somewhere you've never been before. While I programmed the game to be as immersive as it could be, Text based games will always be niche due to the amount of reading there is with little to no breaks. Thus Voyager_9. A conceptual demo for a rhythm action RPG based off of the story of Control. While only being a demo of the opening scene, I hope it shows were I think the project can go given enough time. Built entirely from the ground up in Unity, I hoped to further my knowledge of game development and thus built all the scripting and interactions without help from outside packages. This means it is a poorly optimized, buggy, and very short compared to the work put in. However, I learned more than enough to justify my time spent. I hope you enjoy the Demo, and please look at the known issues before playing. I wasnt able to fix them in time, but I hope to come back to it someday in the future. <br> JR<br><br>

Known issues:<br>
- if you spam space while in multi line text, it can overlap/ bugg out
- enemy collision is bad, can stick on eachother
- ending doesnt always trigger correctly, causing a line to be skipped
- wall collision isnt perfect
- player can sometimes be moved off of the center of the grid during combat (not game breaking just looks weird)
