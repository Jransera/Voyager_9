# Voyager_9:

temp:<br>
A reimagining of a past game I created alongside a team in 2018. This is a conceptual demo, with placement textures and music. 
It shows the opening section of the game and the main mechanics. 
I built this all from the ground up in Unity, with no outside packages besides TMPro. <br><br>


Controls:<br>
Space: Continue after dialogue is done (wait until its done or it can bug sometimes lol).<br>
WASD : Move.<br>
E    : Use weapon.<br>
Q    : Dash in the direction you are moving.<br>
ESC  : Pause/ UnPause.<br>
O    : Restart game from begining.<br><br>

The Original Game:<br>

Known issues:<br>
- if you spam space while in multi line text, it can overlap/ bugg out
- enemy collision is bad, can stick on eachother
- ending doesnt always trigger correctly, causing a line to be skipped
- wall collision isnt perfect
- player can sometimes be moved off of the center of the grid during combat (not game breaking just looks weird)
